# Flight-Delay-Prediction-with-Pre-Departure-Data
This project studies how well flight departure delays (≥15 minutes) can be predicted using only information available before takeoff. Multiple models and feature representations were tested, showing that performance is primarily limited by the informational content of the data rather than model complexity.
